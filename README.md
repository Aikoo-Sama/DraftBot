# How to launch the bot

*Before creating your own instance, please note that you can add the bot to your server through the link available on the bot's discord*
**If you decide to work on the creation of your own instance of the bot, you are supposed to have a minimum of computer skills. Bot support team will prioritizes players of the main instance and will only provide limited assistance.**

Here is a short start guide.

* Download or clone the repository.
* Execute the `npm install` command
* Create a `DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure/modules/data` folder
* Edit the `DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure/modules/utils/Config-Example.js` file
* Rename the file `DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure/modules/utils/Config-Example.js to DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure/modules/utils/Config.json
* Launch the bot using the `node draftbot` command
* Wait for the generation of the database (~10 secs)
* Restart the bot by repeating the command above

# Common errors:

* Some potions (id 1 to 24) use personalized emojis. Replace these in the following files:
`DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure\modules\utils\items\en.json`
`DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure\modules\utils\items\fr.json`
